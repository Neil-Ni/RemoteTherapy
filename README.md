Remote Therapy is a project that was developed with the Developmental Psychology Laboratory at Waseda
 University in Japan. This application enables family members ("senders") to video-chat, upload familiar
 images, and monitor their relatives who are suffering from Alzheimer's ("receivers"), thus creating a
 possibility for interaction between patients and their family members, who may not always be physically
present. The intended purpose of this application is to improve patients' memory performance by increasing
 their interactions with loved ones.
